Realizing a weather analysis for the new bussiness in Hawaii


# The main objective of this project is given by the analysis of a weather database, that will allow an investor to make a better decision in referance to opening a new shop in Hawaii. The precipitations and the temperature will be important variables that will influence the decision making.
 
## Results of the analysis
The weather analysis has two main obectives, to evidentiate on one hand the summary statistics for the month of June, and on the other hand the summary statistic for the month of December.
In the first part of the analysis, we were able to filter the column of Measurements table from the database to retrieve all the temperatures from June, followed by the coversion of the temperature into a list. Creating a data frame has allowed us to get finalise our objective by obtainig the statistics:   - the count 1700,
     - the mean - the average temperature being 74,94 degrees, 
     - standard deviation is 3.25,
     - the lowest temperature recorded was 64 degrees,
     _ the highest temperature of June throughout the years was recorded being 85 degrees
Also, we were able to calculate the upper, and lower quartile, as well as the median, as is shown in the photo bellow.

 Using the same process, we were able to summarize the statistics for the month of December, obtaing the following results:
        - the count 1517,
        - the mean - the average temperature in December was 71,94 degrees, 
        - standard deviation is 3.74,
        - the lowest temperature recorded was 56 degrees,
        _ the highest temperature of June throughout the years was recorded being 83 degrees

On the first look to the data, after using the describe function we could tell that the difference in the average temperatures between June and December is only 3 degrees, the former month registering the highest value.

Another outcome of the analysis is the comparison of the lowest temperature of 64 degrees Fahrenheit in June, and 56 in December, the difference being very significant of 8 degrees. On contrary, the less significant difference just by 2 degrees,  is given by the highest temperature 85 degrees in June and 83 in December.
Last, comparing the standard deviation between June and December, we could notice that there is a difference of 0.49.

Summary
Summarizing this report, based on differences in temperature between the month of June and the month of December, we could affirm that the weather in Hawaii allows locals and visitors to  surf ans also enjoying different assortisements of icecream. Considering this, it would be a good ideea to invest in the new store. The dababased analysed, provides new opportunities to retrieve info related to the precipitations, and also analysing a trend of the temperatures over a delimited period of time.
